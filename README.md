# Sentiment-Analysis
This project will employ sentiment analysis with Recurrent 
Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) 
networks. The objective is to classify text data—usually reviews 
or comments—into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. We 
used publicly accessible data, preprocessed them with standard 
NLP practices, and trained prediction models. Experiment 
results do show that LSTM models perform better than simple 
RNNs when dealing with long-term dependencies in text with 
higher accuracy and generalization. 

• **Background Information** 

Opinion mining or sentiment mining is a natural language 
processing technique used to determine the sentiment of a 
specified piece of text. It is frequently used in applications such 
as customer feedback analysis, brand monitoring, and social 
media measurement.
